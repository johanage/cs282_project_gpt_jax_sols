        "In this homework, we will be exploring the world of [Flax](http://flax.readthedocs.io/) and [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax), two powerful deep learning libraries made by Google that can be used to reimplement the PyTorch version of minGPT. Jax and Flax are both built on the concept of functional programming and provide a high-level interface for building and training neural networks, which can simplify the development process and reduce the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written. Flax and Jax are designed to take advantage of modern hardware architectures such as GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly speed up the training process and reduce the time-to-deployment for new models.\n",
        "<br/> By using these libraries, you will gain a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of neural networks and develop your skills in functional programming. You will also have the opportunity to compare and contrast the PyTorch and Flax/Jax versions of minGPT, gaining valuable insights into the similarities and differences between these powerful tools. So let's roll up our sleeves and dive into the world of Flax and Jax!"

We then train the model to predict the next character in the sequence given the preceding characters as input. Once the model is trained, we can use it to generate new text by feeding it a starting sequence (context) and iteratively sampling new characters from the model's predicted distribution until the desired length of text is generated.
