# cs182/282_project_gpt_jax

This project aims to make a homework assignment on the implementation of the model architecture and using word embeddings to make an autocomplete model using the GPT model architecture. It includes an additional component where we want to push students to make their own reflections on the societal impact of the model. The main part of the HW is based on Andrej Karpathy's smaller version of the GPT model, called minGPT. minGPT is originally a PyTorch re-implementation of GPT, a highly successful language modeling framework developed by OpenAI. It is a lightweight and efficient implementation of GPT, designed to be easy to use and highly customizable. With its modular architecture and flexible design, minGPT is a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners working in natural language processing and related fields. Students will train the minGPT model on an excerpt of a compilation of different works by Nietzsche - “a German philosopher, prose poet, cultural critic, philologist, and composer”, and then be able to create autocomplete text from sentence prompts fed into the model!
